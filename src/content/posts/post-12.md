Itâ€™s April 8, 1940 and HMS Glowworm is in the North Sea. Commanded by Captain Gerard Broadmead Roope, it became separated from its battle group. Upon detecting an unknown ship, they realize it is a German vessel. HMS Glowworm bravely fought first one then two German destroyers who outgunned her. The German Destroyers call for help and the massive cruiser, Admiral Hipper answers appearing on the scene firing at HMS Glowworm. In this David vs Goliath battle the Glowworm is severely outgunned. Despite suffering heavy damage, Captain Roope orders a daring torpedo attack and retreats behind a smoke screen. As the intact Hipper emerges from the smoke Roope knows it's all over. Roope, with no options left to him commands a desperate last move: ramming the Admiral Hipper. An incredibly brave action that won him the respect and admiration of his enemy.
