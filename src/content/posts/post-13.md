In this gripping episode, we dive into the remarkable story of two brave medics assigned to the 101st Airborne, Ken Moore and Robert Wright, who risked their lives during the fierce battles of Normandy in World War II. Amidst the chaos, they set up a makeshift aid station in a church displaying a prominent red cross, treating wounded soldiers from both sides of the conflict.

As the battle intensified and house-to-house combat erupted in the village, Moore and Wright found themselves with limited medical supplies, relying on their medic bags and the soldiers' pocket first aid kits. Despite the dire situation, their dedication to their duty remained unwavering. Venturing into the heart of the battleground, Ken Moore would put his life on the line, protected only by the red cross on his helmet and armband, to save the lives of those in need.

Witness the incredible acts of courage and humanity by these two medics who transcended the boundaries of war to save both friends and enemies alike. Through this awe-inspiring tale, we'll explore the power of compassion and the extraordinary lengths these men went to preserve life amidst the horrors of war. Don't miss this emotional journey into the past, as we honor the brave actions of Ken Moore and Robert Wright, the unsung heroes of Normandy.
