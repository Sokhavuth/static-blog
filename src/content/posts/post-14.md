It’s December 9th, 1941. And line of Blenheim Bombers of the roars to life at Butterworth Airfield, Malaysia. At the front is Squadron Leader Arthur “Pongo” Scarf. But while they are still taking off a transmission comes in. “Bandits to the north!” High in the sky dozens of Ki-27 fighter bombers approach in formation. Then more Ki-27s come in for a lower attack and strafe the airfield. All the planes on the ground except one are incapacitated. Incredibly the crew of this lone Blenheim decide to go on with their mission, alone. Despite his injuries Scarf made a landing near to the hospital where his wife was working and got to see her one last time.
