It’s the 17th of January 1945 in the outskirts of the French town of Herrlisheim.
Obersturmführer Erwin Bachmann is in a sidecar when he spots two Panther tanks right on the edge of the town.  Taking command he goes on to engage with 14 Shermans tanks. 2 Panthers versus 14 Shermans! With perfect timing and planning he directs the Panthers to block the Sherman's in causing 12 to surrender. When the dust settled Bachmann’s actions with just 2 Panthers resulted in the capture of 60 American tank crew members, the release of 20 German POW’s, and the capture of 12 completely intact Sherman tanks. Obersturmführer Erwin Bachmann would be awarded the Knight’s Cross for his leadership, and the tank crews would be awarded the Iron Cross for their performance. The captured Shermans would go on to serve for the German army, being used in anger against the allies in the dying months of the war.
