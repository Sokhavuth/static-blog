It’s September 18th, 1939, in the Polish countryside near the village of Pociecha. Section Commander Edmund Roman Orlik leads three TKS tankettes as they scour the land for the enemy. Then, before his eyes a beast rolls into view. The biggest tank in the Polish battlefield, the Panzer 4 B. The tankettes are tiny 2-man vehicles, built in the interwar period around the idea of a mobile machinegun. Orlik’s model isn’t like most. His TKS has replaced the 7.92mm machine gun with a 20mm autocannon capable of firing 5 round clips in less than a second, creating a small and sneaky, albeit fragile, tank hunter. Who would win in this David and Goliath scenario?
