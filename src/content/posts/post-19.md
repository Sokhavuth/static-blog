The notorious German Operation Eisbär is underway. Many dozens of V-1 cruise missiles fall
on the civilian infrastructure of British cities everyday. Just one missile is enough to destroy amassive building completely.

The Germans call this fearsome weapon Vergeltungswaffe — The Vengeance Weapon. The
Allied pilots call it the diver, doodle-bug or flying Bomb. Several times a day special patrols
scramble to intercept a new pack of flying bombs.

Spitfires could barely match the speed requiring pilots to dive from high altitudes in order to
close in on their targets at distances as short as several hundred yards. This sometimes
resulted in debris from the exploding V1 flying into the Spitfire’s fuselage. To avoid the blast risk, some pilots figured out that you could override the gyroscopes of the V1s through “wing tipping” technique. This involved flying alongside the V1 and using exceptional flying skills to flick the v1 over. Many have questioned whether this really happened but we used the memoirs of
Australian, Ken Roy Collier who served in 91 squadron RAF in the making of this film.
