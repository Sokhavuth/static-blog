Could it be that a US Submarine was so successful during the Second World War that a submarine crew sank a Japanese train? Well, yes... It’s not like the submarine blew the train from the water…. But what happened is an incredible story of how the crew of the USS Barb, the most successful American submarine of the war, landed men behind enemy lines and completed a textbook act of sabotage, and revolutionized submarine warfare twice in one patrol.
