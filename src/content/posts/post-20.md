The American soldiers and tanks of the C company of the 752nd Tank Battalion navigate through the woods and fields, facing gunfire from an invisible enemy. The commanding officer, Frank L Heaton Jr, attempts to make sense of the situation and orders his tanks to fire upon the tree line ahead. They come under heavy fire and Heaton is struggling to see through the periscopes. Eventually, they spot a Panzer 4 tank firing from the top of a hill and successfully take it out along with two other tanks using their 75mm cannons. They continue to push forward, with the commanding officer keeping a watchful eye for any remaining resistance, but find nothing. The American tanks continue to advance unopposed, with the enemy tracks showing retreat and disappearing on a road.  The Americans continue to push forward until they are way into enemy territory.
