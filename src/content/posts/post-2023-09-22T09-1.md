It’s 1942, off the coast of Singapore, and a River Steamer commandeered by the British is attacked by Japanese bombers. Captain Thomas Wilkinson of the HMS Li Wo leads his crew in a desperate resistance, and escapes. When the Li Wo continues on its journey through the Bangka strait, their hopes are dashed when they spot a Japanese fleet 10 miles ahead. They could try and lay low and try avoid detection but the small crew on a commandeered boat take an incredibly brave decision. Despite being massively outnumbered and outgunned, they’ll fight.
