Itâ€™s the evening of August 17th, 1950, near the city of Pusan, in South Korea. UN forces have been pushed back from the moment they became involved, going from just south of Seoul to cornered against the sea in Pusan in just a month. The North Koreans are equipped with Soviet T34-85s, which outnumber and outgun the American tanks, leaving the soldiers fighting them with bazookas or no anti-tank weapons at all. Lieutenant Granville George "GG" Sweet leads a four tank platoon of M26 Pershings, which have been performing well in the defense of Pusan, but is about to face the tank that has been dominating the battlefield in the last month. An urgent message arrives through the radio, "Flash Purple!" incoming enemy armor. Sweet and his crew prepare for combat and engage in a fierce tank battle against the T34-85s. They form a wall across a road and aim straight ahead as the enemy approaches. Fullerton takes his position, when suddenly a T-34 rounds the corner before him.
