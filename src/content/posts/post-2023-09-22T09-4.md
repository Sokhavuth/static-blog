The Henderson twins were the real life inspiration behind Warpath's latest cinematic trailer. They were both in the national guard when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Transferred to a tank destroyer battalion they saw action in North Africa and then on to Italy.  It's not the same story as in the trailer. In fact it's very different but its a great story of real brothers in arms.
