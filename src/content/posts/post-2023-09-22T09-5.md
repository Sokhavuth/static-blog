Itâ€™s a cold, foggy morning on September 19th, 1944. At an allied camp near the town of Arracourt, France. 

2nd Lieutenant and Platoon Leader Ed Leiper waits anxiously by the command tent alongside his Commanding Officer and Company Commander Tom Evans. A communication comes through - Enemy tanks have been spotted !

A few moments later M-18 Hellcats of the C Company 3rd Platoon roll out of the base led by two Willys Jeeps. What happens next is an Epic tank battle through the fog of American Hellcats vs German Panzer 4s.
