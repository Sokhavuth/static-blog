It’s September the 10th, 1952.

And a pair of F4U-4B Corsair’s make their way across a clear North Korean skies. On board the lead plane is Captain Jesse Folmar of the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron number  312, also known as the “Checkerboards”

Folmar scans the shores as the pair fly straight into the mouth of the Taedong river. There has been a reported enemy movement on the south shores of the river mouth. However, Folmar can’t see anything out of the ordinary.  That is until they are intercepted by MiG-15s ! Its an incredible story of powerful WW2 fighters vs the latest  fighters of the jet age.
