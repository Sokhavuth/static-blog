It’s midnight on August 17, 1919, offshore on the Gulf of Finland.

The silence of the sea is broken by the rumble of speedboats racing across the water, their bows bouncing on the calm waves. On their stern, they carry 18 inch torpedoes.

Their mission is simple and daring. Attack a heavily armed Russian port. 

They are to use the speedboat’s small size to sail over Russian minefields and attack the Russian Baltic fleet docked at the port of Kronstadt.  Small motorboats versus a heavily armed base.

The British are trying to prevent Bolshevik forces from using their fleet against the Estonians who are fighting a desperate war for independence.

It's an incredible story of bravery and daring.  A David and Goliath encounter of small motorboats against the might of a Russian stronghold.
