Itâ€™s midday on February 9th, 1944, near the harbor of Nice, southern France.
4 Supermarine Spitfires belonging to the 4th squadron of the 52nd Fighter Group circle their targets. One by one they dive, unleashing bombs and a volley of gunfire into the convoy of cargo ships below.

On board of one of these fighters is pilot Robert Anderson Hoover.

Hoover is making a turn when suddenly a single 20mm shell strikes him at the root of the wing. In a blur the wing shears off and his Spitfire twists in an uncontrollable tumble. Hoover hangs on and pulls himself out of the doomed machine.

Captured, Hoover is interred in Stalag Luft I, a prison camp outside Barth, Germany.
When he finally escapes he manages to get to safety by stealing a Luftwaffe FW-190.  
It's an incredible story of an amazing pilot and his bid to reach home.
