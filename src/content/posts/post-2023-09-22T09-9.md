The 303 Squadron.  A legendary outfit made up mainly from Polish aces in exile.  Initially frowned upon by the British as undisciplined and lacking skill, the Poles took to their Hawker Hurricanes and became heroes during the battle of Britain. Mirosław Ferić kept a diary of the squadron's exploits, victories and losses. While it's difficult to estimate the exact contribution of every unit into such huge battles as the Battle of Britain. Beyond all question, 303 Squadron was one of the most impactful units of the RAF. Initial wartime reports mention 126 victories by 303 Squadron during the Battle. According to the most recent research they are credited with over 58 verified victories, which still makes them the most efficient aerial unit in the Battle.
