In 1966 Vietnam, U.S. Marine Corps snipers Carlos Hathcock, known as Lông Trắng (The White Feather), and John Burke are on a mission to eliminate a deadly NVA sniper, Cobra, who's been terrorizing their base. After Cobra claims another victim, the Marines set off on a dangerous manhunt, determined to make him their last victim. Hathcock's sharp instincts lead them to a concealed sniper's position, setting them on a trail deeper into the jungle.

The hunt continues into a second day, fraught with uncertainty and risk. Suspicion mounts as they find an unusually clean burrow at the end of the trail - an obvious trap. Hathcock and Burke take a detour, evading the trap and setting up a vantage point over Cobra's hideout. Hathcock spots a flock of birds feeding on rice - a clever warning system set up by Cobra.

Capitalizing on this, Hathcock creates a distraction by throwing a stick at the birds. As the jungle falls silent, Hathcock readies himself, waiting for Cobra to investigate the disturbance. This suspenseful video captures the deadly cat-and-mouse game in the unforgiving jungles of Vietnam.
