During WWII, hundreds of thousands of women served in the Red Army, including Aliya Moldagulova, an 18-year-old sniper from Kazakhstan. On January 14, 1944, Aliya's bravery and sharpshooting skills came to the fore during a pivotal fight on the Eastern Front. Despite shrapnel injury and a damaged rifle, Aliya continued to eliminate enemy soldiers, even taking on front-line fighting, an unusual move for a sniper. The ultimate objective was to capture the strategically important Nasva railway station to cut off German supply lines. 

In a desperate situation, Aliya rallied her fellow soldiers after their leader fell, spearheading the attack into enemy trenches and disabling an enemy machine gun post.
