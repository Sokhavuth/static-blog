It’s the 4th of December 1950 and 6 F4U Corsairs of Fighter Squadron 32 fly low over the snow-topped mountains of North Korea. At the controls of two of the fighters are aviators Thomas J. Hudner and Jesse LeRoy Brown. They are brothers in arms and best friends on a mission to protect US Marines against Chinese advance. But suddenly the mission takes a turn for the worse with a single transmission.

 “Jesse, you are streaming something. It looks as if you are streaming fuel.”
Tom turns his attention to his friend’s aircraft and is concerned to see a trail of liquid leaking from behind the aircraft. Aboard the stricken Corsair, Jesse is quick to confirm the men’s fears.

 “Yes, I am losing fuel. And I don’t know how long I’ll be able to stay up.”

What happened next was an incredible act of bravery where Tom would deliberately put his plane down on a mountainside in hostile territory to try and save his friend.
