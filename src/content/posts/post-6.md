On June 13th, 1944, in the French town of Villers-Bocage, south of Normandy hidden in the bushes a beast stalks its prey. A Tiger tank of the 2nd Company of the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Standing atop its cupola is the most decorated German Panzer ace in history; Lieutenant Michael Wittmann aka The Black Baron. A reckless attack or a daring tank battle. Wittman's actions at Villers Bocage became disputed and legendary.  There are many sources that conflict for this story but we tried to pull together a narrative from the many sources that are out there. Any errors are our own.
