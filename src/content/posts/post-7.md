It’s September 1st 1939 and war is once again rising in Europe. Germany has started the invasion of Poland and one of it’s first assaults is on the Polish Post office in the free city of Gdansk. 56 Postal workers and supporters are inside bracing themselves for the enemy. They face German SS and police supported by armored cars and artillery. It should be a one sided fight. But the determined resistance of the Poles keeps the Germans at bay for over fourteen hours.
