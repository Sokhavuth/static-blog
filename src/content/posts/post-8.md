Captain Kemble "Cowboy" Tucker is in command of Company A of the 36th tank battalion near Rheinberg in March 1945.  They've been given orders to take a bridge and allow the allied invasion of Germany to push forward and into Rheinberg.  They're surprised by the lack of German defenses until the trap is sprung and Company A and it's column of Sherman tanks find themselves in the midst of a firestorm of German artillery, troops and heavy weaponry.  Against a well dug in and prepared opponent, with incredible bravery, Cowboy Tucker leads the charge.
