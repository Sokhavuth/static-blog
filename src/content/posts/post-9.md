Hans Joachim Marseille was doubtless an incredibly talented pilot. He was and is considered by many to be one of, if not the best pilot in the history of aviation. While in North Africa, Marseille unexpectedly dives into an attack against a squadron of enemy Hawker Hurricanes.His daredevil lone assault surprises his own team. Despite missing his first barrage of shots, he remains undeterred, drawing fire from three enemy planes. He masterfully dodges their attack, leaving them behind except for one persistent adversary. Locked in a high-speed dogfight, both pilots try to outmaneuver each other. A miscalculation exposes Marseille to the enemy's fire, causing severe damage to his plane. Although shocked to be alive, he's aware of his critical situation as his damaged plane loses power and the enemy pilot, James Denis, prepares for another attack. In a first-ever concession, Marseille flees, diving towards the safety of his airfield. Denis, rather than sealing the kill, opts to assist his embattled squadron, leaving a wounded Marseille to make a desperate escape.  But this isn't the last time the pair meet. What would happen on the second engagement?
